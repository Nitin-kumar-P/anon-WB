    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Anonymous Whistleblower Platform is designed to enable individuals to securely and anonymously report unethical or illegal activities to journalists, legal entities, or other designated recipients. This platform leverages Web3 technologies, including IPFS for decentralized storage and Ethereum for secure transactions, to protect the identity of whistleblowers while ensuring that their reports reach the intended recipients.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User Registration:</strong>
            <p>Journalists or legal entities register on the platform using their Ethereum public key. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt the reports they receive. The platform verifies the identity of these recipients before granting them access.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Anonymous Submission:</strong>
            <p>A user submits a report or uploads sensitive documents to the platform. The report is encrypted using the recipient's public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt and access the information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>IPFS Storage:</strong>
            <p>The encrypted report is uploaded to IPFS, a decentralized storage network. This ensures that the data is securely stored and cannot be altered or deleted by any single entity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Blockchain Transaction:</strong>
            <p>After storing the report on IPFS, the platform generates a blockchain transaction that records the IPFS hash. This transaction is sent to the recipient's public key, notifying them that a new report is available for retrieval.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recipient Access:</strong>
            <p>The recipient can access the report by connecting their wallet to the platform. The platform verifies their public key and grants them access to decrypt and view the report stored on IPFS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong>
            <p>The platform maintains a transparency log on the blockchain, recording metadata about each submission, such as the submission date, recipient, and status. This log provides an immutable record that can be audited without revealing sensitive details.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> All reports are encrypted with the recipient's public key, ensuring that only they can access the information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Decentralized Storage:</strong> Reports are stored on IPFS, providing secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof storage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Anonymity:</strong> The platform protects the whistleblower's identity by anonymizing the submission process and using secure channels for data transmission.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Blockchain Transparency:</strong> The use of blockchain technology ensures that all actions on the platform are recorded and transparent, without compromising the anonymity of the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optional Follow-Up:</strong> Recipients can send follow-up messages to the whistleblower via an anonymous relay, allowing for further communication if necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>
